# Group Policy and Mobile Device Management (MDM) settings for Microsoft Edge

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10
- Windows 10 Mobile

Microsoft Edge works with Group Policy and Microsoft Intune to help you manage your organization's computer settings. Group Policy objects (GPO's) can include registry-based Administrative Template policy settings, security settings, software deployment information, scripts, folder redirection, and preferences.

By using Group Policy and Intune, you can set up a policy setting once, and then copy that setting onto many computers. For example, you can set up multiple security settings in a GPO that's linked to a domain, and then apply all of those settings to every computer in the domain.

> [!NOTE]
> For more info about the tools you can use to change your Group Policy objects, see the Internet Explorer 11 topics, [Group Policy and the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617921), [Group Policy and the Local Group Policy Editor](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617922), [Group Policy and the Advanced Group Policy Management (AGPM)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617923), and [Group Policy and Windows PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=617924).

## Group Policy settings
Microsoft Edge works with these Group Policy settings (`Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Microsoft Edge\`) to help you manage your company's web browser configurations:

### Allow Address bar drop-down list suggestions
- **Supported versions:** Windows 10, version 1703

- **Description:** This policy setting lets you decide whether the Address bar drop-down functionality is available in Microsoft Edge. We recommend disabling this setting if you want to minimize network connections from Microsoft Edge to Microsoft services.

    - If you enable or don't configure this setting (default), employees can see the Address bar drop-down functionality in Microsoft Edge.

    - If you disable this setting, employees won't see the Address bar drop-down functionality in Microsoft Edge. This setting also disables the user-defined setting, "Show search and site suggestions as I type".

        > [!Note]
        > Disabling this setting turns off the Address bar drop-down functionality. Therefore, because search suggestions are shown in the drop-down, this setting takes precedence over the "Configure search suggestions in Address bar" setting.

### Allow Adobe Flash
- **Supported versions:** Windows 10 or later

- **Description:** This setting lets you decide whether employees can run Adobe Flash in Microsoft Edge.

    - If you enable or don't configure this setting (default), employees can use Adobe Flash.
    
    - If you disable this setting, employees can't use Adobe Flash.

### Allow clearing browsing data on exit

- **Description:** This policy setting lets you decide whether F12 Developer Tools are available on Microsoft Edge.

    - If you enable or don’t configure this setting (default), Microsoft Edge periodically downloads the latest version of the list from Microsoft, applying the updates during browser navigation. Visiting any site on the Microsoft Compatibility List prompts the employee to use Internet Explorer 11, where the site is automatically rendered as though it’s in whatever version of IE is necessary for it to appear properly.
    
    - If you disable this setting, the Microsoft Compatibility List isn’t used during browser navigation.

    - If you disable this setting, users can't add search engines or change the default used in the address bar.

### Allow web content on New Tab page

### Configure additional search engines

    >[!Note]
    >If there’s an .xml file in the cache container, IE waits 65 seconds and then checks the local cache for a newer version of the file from the server, based on standard caching rules. If the server file has a different version number than the version in the cache container, the server file is used and stored in the cache container.<p>
