# Olympia Corp enrollment guidelines

Welcome to Olympia Corp. Here are the steps to add your account to your PC.

As part of Windows Insider Lab for Enterprise, you can upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise from Windows 10 Pro. This upgrade is optional. Since certain features such as Windows Defender Application Guard are only available on Windows 10 Enterprise, we recommend you to upgrade.

Choose one of the following two enrollment options:

1. [Keep your current Windows 10 edition](#enrollment-keep-current-edition)

2. [Upgrade your Windows 10 edition from Pro to Enterprise](#enrollment-upgrade-to-enterprise)
