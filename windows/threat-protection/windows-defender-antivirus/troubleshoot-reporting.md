# Troubleshoot Windows Defender Antivirus reporting in Update Compliance

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10

**Audience**

- IT administrators

When you use [Windows Analytics Update Compliance to obtain reporting into the protection status of machines or endpoints](/windows/deployment/update/update-compliance-using#wdav-assessment) in your network that are using Windows Defender Antivirus, you may encounter problems or issues.

Typically, the most common indicators of a problem are:
- You only see a small number or subset of all the devices you were expecting to see
- You do not see any devices at all
- The reports and information you do see is outdated (older than a few days)

For common error codes and event IDs related to the Windows Defender AV service that are not related to Update Compliance, see the [Windows Defender Antivirus events](troubleshoot-windows-defender-antivirus.md) topic. 

There are three steps to troubleshooting these problems:

1. Confirm that you have met all pre-requisites
2. Check your connectivity to the Windows Defender cloud-based service
3. Submit support logs

>[!IMPORTANT]
>It typically takes 3 days for devices to start appearing in Update Compliance


## Confirm pre-requisites

In order for devices to properly show up in Update Compliance, you have to meet certain pre-requisites for both the Update Compliance service and for Windows Defender AV protection:

>[!div class="checklist"]
>- Endpoints are using Windows Defender Antivirus as the sole antivirus protection app. [Using any other antivirus app will cause Windows Defender AV to disable itself](windows-defender-antivirus-compatibility.md) and the endpoint will not be reported in Update Compliance.
> - [Cloud-delivered protection is enabled](enable-cloud-protection-windows-defender-antivirus.md).
> - Endpoints can [connect to the Windows Defender AV cloud](configure-network-connections-windows-defender-antivirus.md#validate-connections-between-your-network-and-the-cloud)
> - If the endpoint is running Windows 10 version 1607 or earlier, [Windows 10 telemetry must be set to the Enhanced level](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/configure-windows-telemetry-in-your-organization#enhanced-level).
> - It has been 3 days since all requirements have been met

If the above pre-requisites have all been met, you may need to proceed to the next step to collect diagnostic information and send it to us.
