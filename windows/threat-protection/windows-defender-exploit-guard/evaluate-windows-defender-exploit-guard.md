Windows Defender Exploit Guard is a new collection of tools and features that help you keep your network safe from exploits. Exploits are infection vectors for malware that rely on vulnerabilities in software.

Windows Defender Exploit Guard is comprised of four features. We've developed evaluation guides for each of the features so you can easily and quickly see how they work and determine if they are suitable for your organization.

Before you begin, you should read the main [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](windows-defender-exploit-guard.md) topic to get an understanding of each of the features and what their prerequisutes are.
