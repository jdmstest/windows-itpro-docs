Attack surface reduction is a feature that is part of Windows Defender Exploit Guard. It helps prevent actions and apps that are typically used by exploit-seeking malware to infect machines. 



## Enable and audit Attack surface reduction rules

You can use Group Policy, PowerShell, or MDM CSPs to configure the state or mode for each rule. This can be useful if you only want to enable some rules, or you want to enable rules individually in audit mode.

For further details on how audit mode works, and when you might want to use it, see the [audit Windows Defender Exploit Guard topic](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md).

Attack surface reduction rules are identified by their unique rule ID. 

You can manually add the rules by using the GUIDs in the following table:

Rule description | GUIDs 
-|-
Block executable content from email client and webmail | BE9BA2D9-53EA-4CDC-84E5-9B1EEEE46550
Block Office applications from creating child processes | D4F940AB-401B-4EFC-AADC-AD5F3C50688A
Block Office applications from creating executable content  | 3B576869-A4EC-4529-8536-B80A7769E899
Block Office applications from injecting into other processes | 75668C1F-73B5-4CF0-BB93-3ECF5CB7CC84
Impede JavaScript and VBScript to launch executables | D3E037E1-3EB8-44C8-A917-57927947596D
Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts  | 5BEB7EFE-FD9A-4556-801D-275E5FFC04CC
Block Win32 imports from Macro code in Office | 92E97FA1-2EDF-4476-BDD6-9DD0B4DDDC7B

See the [Attack surface reduction](attack-surface-reduction-exploit-guard.md) topic for details on each rule.

### Use Group Policy to enable Attack surface reduction rules


1.  On your Group Policy management machine, open the [Group Policy Management Console](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc731212.aspx), right-click the Group Policy Object you want to configure and click **Edit**.

3.  In the **Group Policy Management Editor** go to **Computer configuration**.

4.  Click **Policies** then **Administrative templates**.

5.  Expand the tree to **Windows components > Windows Defender Antivirus > Windows Defender Exploit Guard > Attack surface reduction**.

6. Double-click the **Configure Attack surface reduction rules** setting and set the option to **Enabled**. You can then set the individual state for each rule in the options section:
    - Click **Show...** and enter the rule ID in the **Value name** column and your desired state in the **Value** column as follows:
        -  Block mode = 1
        -  Disabled = 0
        -  Audit mode = 2

 ### Use PowerShell to enable Attack surface reduction rules

1. Type **powershell** in the Start menu, right click **Windows PowerShell** and click **Run as administrator**
2. Enter the following cmdlet:

    ```PowerShell
    Set-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids <rule ID> -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions Enabled
    ```



You can enable the feature in audit mode using the following cmdlet:

```PowerShell
Add-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids <rule ID> -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions AuditMode
```

Use `Disabled` insead of `AuditMode` or `Enabled` to turn the feature off.

>[!IMPORTANT>
>You must specify the state individually for each rule, but you can combine rules and states in a comma seperated list. 
>
>In the following example, the first two rules will be enabled, the third rule will be disabled, and the fourth rule will be enabled in audit mode:
>
>```PowerShell
>Set-MpPreference -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Ids <rule ID 1>,<rule ID 2>,<rule ID 3>,<rule ID 4> -AttackSurfaceReductionRules_Actions Enabled, Enabled, Disabled, AuditMode
>```


You can also the `Add-MpPreference` PowerShell verb to add new rules to the existing list. 

>[!WARNING]
>`Set-MpPreference` will always overwrite the existing set of rules. If you want to add to the existing set, you should use `Add-MpPreference` instead.
>You can obtain a list of rules and their current state by using `Get-MpPreference`


### Use MDM CSPs to enable Attack surface reduction rules

Use the [./Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Defender/AttackSurfaceReductionRules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-defender#defender-attacksurfacereductionrules) configuration service provider (CSP) to individually enable and set the mode for each rule.
