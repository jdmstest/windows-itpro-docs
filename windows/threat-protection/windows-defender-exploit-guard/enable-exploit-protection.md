Exploit protection applies helps protect devices from malware that use exploits to spread and infect. It consists of a number of mitigations that can be applied at either the operating system level, or at the individual app level.

Many of the features that are part of the [Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/jj653751) are included in Exploit protection. 

It is part of [Windows Defender Exploit Guard](windows-defender-exploit-guard.md).



## Enable and audit Exploit protection

You enable and configure each Exploit protection mitigation separately. Some mitigations apply to the entire operating system, while others can be targeted towards specific apps. 

The mitigations available in Exploit protection are enabled or configured to their default values automatically in Windows 10. However, you can customize the configuration to suit your organization and then deploy that configuration across your network. 

You can also set mitigations to audit mode. Audit mode allows you to test how the mitigations would work (and review events) without impacting the normal use of the machine.

For background information on how audit mode works, and when you might want to use it, see the [audit Windows Defender Exploit Guard topic](audit-windows-defender-exploit-guard.md).

You can also convert an existing EMET configuration file (in XML format) and import it into Exploit protection. This is useful if you have been using EMET and have a customized series of policies and mitigations that you want to keep using.

See the following topics for instructions on configuring Exploit protection mitigations and importing, exporting, and converting configurations:

1. [Configure the mitigations you want to enable or audit](customize-exploit-protection.md)
2. [Export the configuration to an XML file that you can use to deploy the configuration to multiple machines](import-export-exploit-protection-emet-xml.md).
