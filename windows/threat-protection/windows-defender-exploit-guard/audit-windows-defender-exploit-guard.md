# Use audit mode to evaluate Windows Defender Exploit Guard features

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10 Insider Preview

[!include[Prerelease information](prerelease.md)]

**Audience**

- Enterprise security administrators


You can enable each of the features of Windows Defender Explot Guard in audit mode. This lets you see a record of what *would* have happened if you had enabled the feature.

You might want to do this when testing how the feature will work in your organization, to ensure it doesn't affect your line-of-business apps, and to get an idea of how many suspicious file modification attempts generally occur over a certain period.

While the features will not block or prevent apps, scripts, or files from being modified, the Windows Event Log will record events as if the features were fully enabled. This means you can enable audit mode and then review the event log to see what impact the feature would have had were it enabled.

You can use Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection to get greater granularity into each event, especially for investigating Attack surface reduction rules. Using the Windows Defender ATP console lets you [investigate issues as part of the alert timeline and investigation scenarios](../windows-defender-atp/investigate-alerts-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md).

This topic provides links that describe how to enable the audit functionality for each feature and how to view events in the Windows Event Viewer. 

You can use Group Policy, PowerShell, and configuration servicer providers (CSPs) to enable audit mode.

You can also use the a custom PowerShell script that enables the features in audit mode automatically:

1. Download the [Exploit Guard Evaluation Package](https://aka.ms/mp7z2w) and extract the file *Enable-ExploitGuardAuditMode.ps1* to an easily accessible location on the machine.

1. Type **powershell** in the Start menu.

2. Right-click **Windows PowerShell**, click **Run as administrator** and click **Yes** or enter admin credentials at the prompt.

3. Enter the following in the PowerShell window to enable Controlled folder access and Attack surface reduction in audie mode:
    ```PowerShell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
    <location>\Enable-ExploitGuardAuditMode.ps1
   ```

      Replace \<location> with the folder path where you placed the file. 
      
      A message should appear to indicate that audit mode was enabled.
