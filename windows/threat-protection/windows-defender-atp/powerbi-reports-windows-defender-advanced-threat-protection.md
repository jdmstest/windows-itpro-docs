Understand the security status of your organization, including the status of machines, alerts, and investigations using the Windows Defender ATP reporting feature that integrates with Power BI. 

Windows Defender ATP supports the use of Power BI data connectors to enable you to connect and access Windows Defender ATP data using Microsoft Graph.

Data connectors integrate seamlessly in Power BI, and make it easy for power users to query, shape and combine data to build reports and dashboards that meet the needs of your organization. 

You can easily get started by:
- Creating a dashboard on the Power BI service 
- Building a custom dashboard on Power BI Desktop and tweaking it to fit the visual analytics and reporting requirements of your organization 

You can access these options from the Windows Defender ATP portal. Both the Power BI service and Power BI Desktop are supported. 

## Create a Windows Defender ATP dashboard on Power BI service
Windows Defender ATP makes it easy to create a Power BI dashboard by providing an option straight from the portal. 

1. In the navigation pane, select **Preferences setup** > **Power BI reports**.

2.	Click **Create dashboard**. This opens up a new tab in your browser and loads the Power BI service with data from your organization.

    >Loading your data in the Power BI service can take a few minutes.

3. If this is the first time you’re using Power BI with Windows Defender ATP, you’ll need to sign in and give consent to Windows Defender ATP Power BI app. By providing consent, you’re allowing Windows Defender ATP Power BI to sign in and read your profile, and access your data.
