Before you can create custom threat intelligence (TI) using REST API, you'll need to set up the custom threat intelligence application through the Windows Defender ATP portal.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Preference Setup** > **Threat intel API**.

2. Select **Enable threat intel API**. This activates the **Azure Active Directory application** setup sections with pre-populated values.

3. Copy the individual values or select **Save details to file** to download a file that contains all the values.

  >[!WARNING]
  >The client secret is only displayed once. Make sure you keep a copy of it in a safe place. <br>
  For more information about getting a new secret see, [Learn how to get a new secret](troubleshoot-custom-ti-windows-defender-advanced-threat-protection.md#learn-how-to-get-a-new-client-secret).

4. Select **Generate tokens** to get an access and refresh token.

Youâ€™ll need to use the access token in the Authorization header when doing REST API calls.
