Quickly respond to detected attacks by isolating machines or collecting an investigation package. After taking action on machines, you can check activity details on the Action center.

>[!NOTE]
> These response actions are only available for machines on Windows 10, version  1703.



## Collect investigation package from machines
As part of the investigation or response process, you can collect an investigation package from a machine. By collecting the investigation package, you can identify the current state of the machine and further understand the tools and techniques used by the attacker.

You can download the package (Zip file) and investigate the events that occurred on a machine.

The package contains the following folders:

The machine timeline will include a new event, reflecting that a scan action was submitted on the machine. Windows Defender AV alerts will reflect any detections that surfaced during the scan.

## Restrict app execution
In addition to the ability of containing an attack by stopping malicious processes, you can also lock down a device and prevent subsequent attempts of potentially malicious programs from running.

The action to restrict an application from running applies a code integrity policy that only allows running of files that are signed by a Microsoft issued certificate. This method of restriction can help prevent an attacker from controlling compromised machines and performing further malicious activities.

>[!NOTE]
>You’ll be able to reverse the restriction of applications from running at any time.

1. Select the machine where you'd like to restrict an application from running from. You can select or search for a machine from any of the following views:

  - **Security operations dashboard** - Select the machine name from the Top machines with active alerts section.
  - **Alerts queue** - Select the machine name beside the machine icon from the alerts queue.
  - **Machines list** - Select the machine name from the list of machines.
  - **Search box** - Select Machine from the drop-down menu and enter the machine name.

2.	Open the **Actions** menu and select **Restrict app execution**.

    The Action center shows the submission information:
    ![Image of action center with app restriction](images/atp-action-center-app-restriction.png)


  - **Submission time** - Shows when the action was submitted.
  - **Status** - Indicates any pending actions or the results of completed actions.

When the application execution restriction configuration is applied, a new event is reflected in the machine timeline.


**Notification on machine user**:</br>
When an app is restricted, the following notification is displayed to inform the user that an app is being restricted from running:

![Image of app restriction](images/atp-app-restriction.png) 

## Remove app restriction 
Depending on the severity of the attack and the state of the machine, you can choose to reverse the restriction of applications policy after you have verified that the compromised machine has been remediated.

1.	Select the machine where you restricted an application from running from.

2.	Open the **Actions** menu and select **Remove app restrictions**. 

    ![Image of remove app restrictions](images/atp-actions-remove-app-restrictions.png)

3.	Type a comment and select **Yes, remove restriction** to take action on the application. The machine application restriction will no longer apply on the machine.  


## Isolate machines from the network
Depending on the severity of the attack and the sensitivity of the machine, you might want to isolate the machine from the network. This action can help prevent the attacker from controlling the compromised machine and performing further activities such as data exfiltration and lateral movement.

This machine isolation feature disconnects the compromised machine from the network while retaining connectivity to the Windows Defender ATP service, which continues to monitor the machine.

On Windows 10, version 1710 and above, you'll have additional control over the network isolation level. You can also choose to enable Outlook and Skype for Business connectivity.

>[!NOTE]
>You’ll be able to reconnect the machine back to the network at any time.

1.	Select the machine that you want to isolate. You can select or search for a machine from any of the following views:

  - **Security operations dashboard** - Select the machine name from the Top machines with active alerts section.
  - **Alerts queue** - Select the machine name beside the machine icon from the alerts queue.
  - **Machines list** - Select the machine name from the list of machines.
  - **Search box** - Select Machine from the drop-down menu and enter the machine name.

2.	Open the **Actions** menu and select **Isolate machine**.

    ![Image of isolation confirmation](images/atp-confirm-isolate.png)

4. Type a comment and select **Yes, isolate machine** to take action on the machine.
  
    >[!NOTE]
    >The machine will remain connected to the Windows Defender ATP service even if it is isolated from the network. If you've chosen to enable Outlook and Skype for Business communication, then you'll be able to communicate to the user while the machine is isolated.

   The Action center shows the submission information:
    ![Image of machine isolation](images/atp-machine-isolation.png)

   - **Submission time** - Shows when the action was submitted.
   - **Status** - Indicates any pending actions or the results of completed actions. Additional indications will be provided if you've enabled Outlook and Skype for Business communication.  

When the isolation configuration is applied, a new event is reflected in the machine timeline.

**Notification on machine user**:</br>
When a machine is being isolated, the following notification is displayed to inform the user that the machine is being isolated from the network:

![Image of no network connection](images/atp-notification-isolate.png)

## Release machine from isolation
Depending on the severity of the attack and the state of the machine you can choose to release the machine from isolation after you have verified that the compromised machine has been remediated.
