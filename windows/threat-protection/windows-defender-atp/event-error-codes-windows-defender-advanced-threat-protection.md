# Review events and errors on endpoints with Event Viewer

**Applies to:**

- Event Viewer
- Windows 10 Enterprise
- Windows 10 Education
- Windows 10 Pro
- Windows 10 Pro Education
- Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Windows Defender ATP)

[!include[Prerelease information](prerelease.md)]

You can review event IDs in the [Event Viewer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa745633(v=bts.10).aspx) on individual endpoints.

For example, if endpoints are not appearing in the **Machines list**, you might need to look for event IDs on the endpoints. You can then use this table to determine further troubleshooting steps.

> [!NOTE]
> It can take several days for endpoints to begin reporting to the Windows Defender ATP service.

**Open Event Viewer and find the Windows Defender ATP service event log:**

1.  Click **Start** on the Windows menu, type **Event Viewer**, and press **Enter**.

2.  In the log list, under **Log Summary**, scroll until you see **Microsoft-Windows-SENSE/Operational**. Double-click the item to
    open the log.

  a.  You can also access the log by expanding **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **SENSE** and click on **Operational**.

    > [!NOTE]
	> SENSE is the internal name used to refer to the behavioral sensor that powers Windows Defender ATP.

3.  Events recorded by the service will appear in the log. See the following table for a list of events recorded by the service.
