A typical security breach investigation requires a member of a security operations team to:

1. View an alert on the **Security operations dashboard** or **Alerts queue**
2. Review the indicators of compromise (IOC) or indications of attack (IOAs)
3. Review a timeline of alerts, behaviors, and events from the machine
4. Manage alerts, understand the threat or potential breach, collect information to support taking action, and resolve the alert

Security operation teams can use Windows Defender ATP portal to carry out this end-to-end process without having to leave the portal.

Teams can monitor the overall status of enterprise endpoints from the **Security operations dashboard**, gain insight on the various alerts, their category, when they were observed, and how long theyâ€™ve been in the network at a glance.
